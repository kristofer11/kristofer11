# Hi 👋, I'm Kris!
### I am a web developer in the Seattle, WA area.

* 😄 I am looking for a web developer role.
* 🔭 I'm currently working on a library manager app that will have a web and a mobile version (using ReactJS and React Native).
* 🌱 Recently I have been learning Python and more React Native.
* ⚡ Extensive experience in building UIs with a track record of delivering impactful solutions.
* 💻 I'm getting more aquainted with back-end development - and I'm loving it! So far, just Node.js/Express/MongoDb. Looking to branch out soon!
