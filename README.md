# Hi 👋, I'm Kris!
### I am a web/mobile developer in the Seattle, WA area.

😄 I am looking for a web/app developement role.

🔭 I'm currently working on a website overhaul for a radio station.

🌱 I have nearly completed Nucamp's backend, Python, SQL, DevOps bootcamp. I have already completed their full-stack program, but I wanted to learn another language and dive deeper into backend technology.

⚡ Extensive experience in building web and mobile UIs with a track record of delivering impactful solutions.

💻 While it doesn't include a front-end, one of my favorite projects, Wordie, is a Wordle clone built with Python that uses a web scraper to choose a word from hundreds of previously used words to make sure you never get the same word twice!
