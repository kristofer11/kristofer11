# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Kris!
### I am a web developer from the Seattle, WA area.

* I'm currently working on a library manager app that will have a web and a mobile version (using ReactJS and React Native).
* I am currently looking for a web developer role.
* Over the last month or so I have been learning Python syntax.
* I have a good deal of experience building UI's.
* I'm getting more aquainted with back-end development - and I'm loving it! So far, just Node.js/Express/MongoDb. Looking to branch out soon!
* Reach out to me if you have questions or issues I could be helpful with.
* Fun fact about me: I have been a teacher, substitute teacher, school administrator, and corrections officer.
