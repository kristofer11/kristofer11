# Hi 👋, I'm Kris!
### I am a web/mobile developer in the Spokane-Coeur d'Alene area.

😄 I am passionate about writing user-focused code, especially if it supports education, healthy living, or faith-based non-profits.

🔭 I currently work at Portions Master where I am building the front-end of an innovative, AI-driven flutter application that is helping people meet their health goals.

🌱 While I currently work on a mobile app, I am also very interested in front-end web development, especially if I get to use ReactJS/NextJS.

⚡ I have extensive experience in building web and mobile UIs with a track record of prioritizing user experience.

💻 One of my favorite personal projects, Wordie, is a Wordle clone built with Python that uses a web scraper to choose a word from hundreds of previously used words to make sure you never get the same word twice! [Check it out here!](https://github.com/kristofer11/Wordie)
