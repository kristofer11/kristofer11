# Hi 👋, I'm Kris!
### I am a web developer from the Seattle, WA area.

* I'm currently working on a library manager app that will have a web and a mobile version (using ReactJS and React Native).
* I am currently looking for a web developer role.
* Recently I have been learning Python and more React Native.
* Extensive experience in building UIs with a track record of delivering impactful solutions.
* I'm getting more aquainted with back-end development - and I'm loving it! So far, just Node.js/Express/MongoDb. Looking to branch out soon!
