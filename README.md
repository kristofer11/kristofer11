# Hi 👋, I'm Kris!
### I am a web developer in the Seattle, WA area.

😄 I am looking for a web developer role.

🔭 I'm currently working on a library manager app that will have a web and a mobile version (using ReactJS and React Native).

🌱 I recently enrolled in Nucamp's backend, Python, SQL, DevOps bootcamp. I have already completed their full-stack program, but I'm ready to learn another language and dive deeper into backend technology.

⚡ Extensive experience in building UIs with a track record of delivering impactful solutions.

💻 I'm getting more aquainted with back-end development - and I'm loving it! So far, just Node.js/Express/MongoDb. Looking to branch out soon!
